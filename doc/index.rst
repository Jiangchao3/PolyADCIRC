Welcome to PolyADCIRC's documentation!
==========================================

Python-based framework for running batches of parallel `ADCIRC <adcirc.org>`_
simulations with varying parameters (Manning's *n* and limited variable
bathymetry, etc). Includes documentation for a Python interface to a slightly
modified verion of :program:`GridData` (Griddata_v1.32.F90).
:program:`GridData` is a :program:`FORTRAN` program originally developed by
Seizo Tanaka (ST3) and C.H.Lab., University of Notre Dame.

All code documented here is written for Linux with a bash shell. It can be
modified for other shells. This code requires `GNU Parallel
<http://www.gnu.org/software/parallel/>`_ to be installed in order to run
properly.

Useful scripts are contained in ``examples/``
Python source code for this package is contained in ``polyadcirc/``
