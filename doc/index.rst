   contain the root `toctree` directive.

Welcome to PolyADCIRC's documentation!
===================================

Python-based framework for running batches of parallel `ADCIRC <adcirc.org>`_
simulations with varying parameters (Manning's *n* and limited variable
bathymetry, etc). Includes documentation for a Python interface to a slightly
modified verion of :program:`GridData` (Griddata_v1.32.F90).
:program:`GridData` is a :program:`FORTRAN` program originally developed by
Seizo Tanaka (ST3) and C.H.Lab., University of Notre Dame.

This code also extends the :program:`PolyADCIRC` framework to interface with a slightly
modifed version of :program:`Subdomain ADCIRC v.50`. :program:`Subdomain ADCIRC
v.50` was developed by Alper Altuntas and Jason Simon under the direction of
John Baugh; Department of Civil, Construction, and Enviromental Engineering
North Carolina State University (NCSU), Raleigh, NC 27695.

All code documented here is written for Linux with a bash shell. It can be
modified for other shells. This code requires `GNU Parallel
<http://www.gnu.org/software/parallel/>`_ to be installed in order to run
properly.
